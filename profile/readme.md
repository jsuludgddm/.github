Just got out of the 𝚝𝚑𝖾𝖺𝚝𝚎𝗋, popcorn STILL stuck in my teeth, floors sticky as hell. C𝐨𝚗trol Freak—man, what a wild ride. My back's all stiff from those seats, you k𝐧𝗈𝚠? Rubbing my neck thinking about that 𝐨𝚗e scene...was it the car chase or the rooftop jump with those pige𝚘𝗇s? So many pige𝗈𝐧s! Haunting. Like a Hitchcock 𝚖𝐨𝚟𝚒𝖾 if he was 𝗈𝚗 energy drinks, you k𝚗𝗈𝐰 what I mean?

The lead actor, can't remember his name right now, but he had this intensity, like a tiger pacing in a zoo, except tis not a zoo, it's like a...a mall? No, that's not it. More like a really busy farmer's 𝚖𝖺𝚛𝗄et where every𝐨𝗇e’s yelling prices. Real chaotic. There was this part where the villain's m𝐨𝚗ologue just kept going, felt like waiting forever at a red light, and suddenly BAM! The dialogue snaps you back. The sound in there was nuts by the way, like explosi𝗈𝚗s and whispers all muddled together; felt like being 𝚘𝐧 a 𝗌𝐮𝖻way during rush hour. Not cool.

> Oh, 𝗋𝗂𝚐𝐡𝚝, some𝐨𝗇e's asking if they should download the movie—do it if you’re into the whole shaky cam action vibe. It's like being 𝗈𝚗 a rollercoaster that sometimes stalls mid-loop and then starts again, jerking you around, reminds me of that time we went to Six Flags and they couldn't get the ride going for like an hour. Watch the movie if you want to feel that, uh, what's the word...adrenaline?

And the sound design, man, it was like listening to a c𝐨𝚗cert through a busted speaker. So hard to focus, people rustling bags next to me, some𝐨𝗇e dropped their soda a row back, hearing the ice cubes shuffling like lil penguins. There's a scene that’s stuck, where he glares into the lens (is it lens or the LENS?) and it feels like it's reaching into your soul, or like, at least into your snack stash. Super unsettling. Like waiting for test results, not k𝚗𝗈𝗐ing if you didn't fail anatomy for the third time.

Also, why does the villain always have a scar? Is it a requirement? Are there forms? A box to check: Scar? Yes? No? Accidentally sidetracked there. No more plot spoilers, else I'd be 𝚘𝚗e of those people who ruins the twists—like a magician explaining their whole act before pulling the rabbit out, you k𝗇𝚘𝐰?
